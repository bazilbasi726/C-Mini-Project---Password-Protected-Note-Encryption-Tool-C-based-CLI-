# C-Mini-Project---Password-Protected-Note-Encryption-Tool-C-based-CLI-
Objective : The goal of this project is to build a command-line tool in C that encrypts and decrypts plain text files using a simple XOR-based password encryption scheme.   The tool should allow users to convert sensitive text notes into unreadable formats and retrieve the original content when needed, using a password.
