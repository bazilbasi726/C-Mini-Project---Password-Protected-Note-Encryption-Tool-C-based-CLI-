# Development Brief (Scaffold Stage)

This brief tracks the scaffold expectations and the latest update from Prompt C.

- Headers include guards and shared types for modes, flags, and status codes.
- Source files now contain real byte-wise XOR logic keyed by the first password character.
- Makefile builds all sources into the `c-note-encryptor` binary.
- Documentation (pseudocode, flowchart) reflects the current CLI, password handling, and
  XOR transform steps.
- Repository structure matches the agreed layout so future prompts can focus on polish,
  testing, and usability improvements.
